# 🍲 Dietary Guardian SG
**Singapore Innovation Challenge 2026: Clinical-Grade Dietary Monitoring**

"Culture-First, Safety-Always." Optimized for Singapore's aging population (The "Mr. Tan" Persona).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Astral Stack)

Ensure you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed.

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and sync dependencies
uv sync

# Configure environment variables
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# Optional: Disable remote logfire for local dev
export LOGFIRE_TOKEN="" 
# Optional: local runtime auth (used by Ollama/vLLM profile mode)
export LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY="ollama"
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
# Start the Streamlit Interface
PYTHONPATH=src uv run streamlit run src/app.py
```

### 2a. Local Model Testing (Ollama / vLLM)
```bash
# Ollama example
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3

# vLLM example (separate shell)
uv run python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then in the app sidebar:
- Set `Model runtime` to `local`
- Choose profile `ollama_llama3` or `vllm_qwen`
- Optionally override model name / base URL for local experiments

### 3. CLI Demonstration
```bash
# Run the core logic scenarios (High Sodium & Safety Violation)
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python src/main.py
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Gates

Our system uses a multi-tiered verification strategy to ensure 0% critical safety violations.

### 1. Static Analysis (The Astral Standard)
```bash
# Linting and Formatting
uv run ruff check .

# Strict Type Checking
uv run ty check .
```

### 2. Unit & Integration Tests
```bash
# Run the full test suite
PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest
```

### 3. Clinical Simulation (Hypothesis)
We use property-based testing to simulate "Virtual Patients" and stress-test the safety engine against 10,000+ randomized meal scenarios.
```bash
# Run property-based safety tests
PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest tests/test_virtual_patient.py
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

- **Perception (`Hawker Vision`):** Gemini-3-Flash with Tier 3 Fallback to Health Promotion Board (HPB) standards.
- **Reasoning (`Dietary Agent`):** Pydantic-AI with localized "Uncle Guardian" persona and structured Pydantic outputs.
- **Safety (`Safety Engine`):** Deterministic interceptor backed by `DrugInteractionDB` (SQLite/Mock) and nutritional threshold monitoring.
- **Social (`Social Service`):** Block-level gamification for "Kampong Spirit" healthy eating challenges.
- **Observability (`Logfire`):** Real-time instrumentation for clinical-grade tracing and validation.

## 📊 Current Project Status (v0.1.0)

| Feature | Implementation | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Safety Logic** | 100% | Deterministic clinical interceptor active. |
| **Vision AI** | 90% | Gemini-3-Flash integrated + HPB Fallback logic. |
| **Singlish Persona** | 100% | "Uncle Guardian" agent fully tuned. |
| **Social Dashboard** | 60% | Block scores and leaderboard implemented in Streamlit. |
| **Persistence** | 40% | SQLite schema in place; session state used for prototypes. |

## 🔒 Image Handling Policy
- Meal photos from upload/camera are processed in-memory for analysis.
- Raw image bytes are not persisted to database or long-term storage.
- Only derived metadata and analysis outputs are kept in session state.

## 🇸🇬 Localization: "Hawker Vision 2.0"
Identifies nuances like:
- **Mee Rebus:** Thick gravy + yellow noodles.
- **Mee Siam:** Thin vermicelli + tangy/thin gravy.
- **Laksa:** Coconut milk base + "hum" detection.
